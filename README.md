# Traffic Light with React

> By Keili Rosales

## Objective

Using the ReactDOM.render to process the component in the DOM, simulate a traffic light that shows its three colors and when clicking on any of them lights up around the color, this is possible using the hook useState to store the color that should shine according to the action. 
 
The objective of the exercise is to understand how we can change the value of a variable and how it behaves inside the HTML of the component, using the hook useState.

## Application

1. Install the NPM packages (be sure to use the latest version of node): `npm install`.
2. Run the project using: `npm run start`.
Verify that the component is working and light changes by clicking on any color of the traffic light. 

## Technologies

- ReactJS
